# Pac-Dan
Pac-Man clone made with LibGDX

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24222531/IMAGES/PacDan/pacmanPoster.png)

My goals with this project were as follows:  

1. Create a basic game to become familiar with the libgdx framework. 
2. Practice Art Asset creation. 
3. Reproduce the original Pac-Man game as closely as possible.

The "Pac-Man Dossier" was referred to extensively and was a great help in this project.
